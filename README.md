# slim-fish
Light weight, front-end boilerplate. Developed this project for personal use but you can use it if you find it useful.

---

####What is Slim Fish?
Slim Fish is a light weight front-end boilerplate where it provides you a basic setup for getting started with your front-end project. Spend less time setting up gulp, dir structure, basic files and write some real code instead!

---

####Too many boilerplates, why Slim Fish?
I have came across many boilerplates but some are either bloated with unnecessary third party libraries or some are using common mixins, classes which I don't find useful.

Slim Fish is for you if you like to get started with minimal code. Again, front-end devs have their own preference setting up a dir structure and so on, but I've developed this keeping best practices in mind.
